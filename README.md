## Key differences:

I used a list layout with teal and orange colours. I put the navbar/stepper on left and put the summary area right below that. And added some hover animations.

## Tech stack
  
  I used Vite, react, typescript and styled components.

Data pulled from  
`/api/skips/by-location?postcode=NR32&area=Lowestoft` (as requested).
